# Secure Tunnel Manager

This project is the product of frustration caused by spending $5 per AWS Secure Tunnel.

**If you don't know what AWS Secure Tunnel service is then you are probably happy with your life ;)**

## Features
* Specially designed considering IoT Fleets.
* Persistent Reverse SSH Tunnels for remotely controling and opening other tunnels.
* If deployment code(for edge devices) is to be kept secret, root access will be only allowed to tunnels.
* Statistics and data collected will be shown on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard.
